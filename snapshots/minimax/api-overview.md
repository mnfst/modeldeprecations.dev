## MiniMax-H3 \<NEW>

This API is powered by MiniMax-H3 and supports video generation from multimodal input (text, images, video, audio), covering text-to-video, image-to-video, first-and-last-frame, and reference-to-video scenarios.

**Supported Models**

| Model      | Description                                                                                                                               |
| :--------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MiniMax-H3 | Multimodal video generation model supporting text / image / first-and-last-frame / reference input, 768P / 2K resolution, 4–15s duration. |

**API Usage Guide**

MiniMax-H3 tasks are asynchronous. There are three creation endpoints—**Create Video Generation Task**, **Create H3-Context-IR Task**, and **Create Video Regeneration Task**—and shared endpoints for querying, listing, and cancelling or deleting tasks. The workflow is as follows:

1. Create a video generation task, create an H3-Context-IR task with the same multimodal input, or create a video regeneration task for a source video that meets the MiniMax-H3 768P output specifications. A regeneration request must contain exactly one source-video item with `role=base_video`. All three endpoints return a `task_id` on success.
2. Use **Query Task** with the `task_id` to retrieve its status and result. When a video task succeeds, get its output URL from `content.url`; when an H3-Context-IR task succeeds, get the enhanced prompt from `content.prompt`. You can also use **List Tasks** and distinguish `generation`, `h3_context_ir`, and `regeneration` with `task_type`.
3. Use **Cancel or Delete Task** to cancel a queued task or delete a succeeded or failed task record.

2. Adjustable volume, pitch, speed, and output formats.
3. Support for proportional audio mixing.
4. Configurable fixed time intervals.

## Asynchronous Long-Text Speech Generation

This API supports asynchronous text-to-speech generation. Each request can handle up to **1 million characters**, and the resulting audio can be retrieved asynchronously.

Features supported:

1. Choose from 100+ system voices and cloned voices.
2. Customize pitch, speed, volume, bitrate, sample rate, and output format.
3. Retrieve audio metadata, such as duration and file size.
4. Retrieve precise sentence-level timestamps (subtitles).
5. Input text directly as a string or via `file_id` after uploading a text file.
6. Detect illegal characters:
   * If illegal characters are **≤10%**, audio is generated normally, with the ratio returned.
   * If illegal characters are **>10%**, no audio will be generated (an error code will be returned).

**Note:** The returned audio URL is valid for **9 hours** (32,400 seconds) from the time it is issued. After expiration, the URL becomes invalid and the generated data will be lost.

**Use Case:** Converting entire books or other long texts into audio.

**Supported Models**

## Voice Cloning

This API supports cloning voices from user-uploaded audio files along with optional sample audio to enhance cloning quality.

**Use cases:** fast replication of a target timbre (IP voice recreation, voice cloning) where you need to quickly clone a specific voice.

The API supports cloning from mono or stereo audio and can rapidly reproduce speech that matches the timbre of a provided reference file.

**Supported Models**

| Model            | Description                                                                                              |

| speech-02-hd     | Superior rhythm and stability, with outstanding performance in replication similarity and sound quality. |
| speech-02-turbo  | Superior rhythm and stability, with enhanced multilingual capabilities and excellent performance.        |

### Notes

* Using this API to clone a voice **does not** immediately incur a cloning fee. The cloning fee is charged the **first time** you synthesize speech with the cloned voice in a T2A synthesis API (the preview/audition within this API does not count).
* Voices produced via this rapid cloning API are **temporary**. To keep a cloned voice permanently, call **any** T2A speech synthesis API with that voice **within 168 hours (7 days)** (the preview/audition within this API does not count). If the time limit is exceeded, the voice will be deleted.
* This API is stateless: each call only processes the incoming data, does not store user-uploaded content, and involves no business-logic state.
