## [Model Deprecation](#model-deprecation)

Deprecation refers to the process of retiring older models or endpoints in favor of hosting better models with better capabilities for you to leverage. When we announce that a model or endpoint is being deprecated, we will provide a shutdown date on which the model or endpoint will no longer be accessible. As such, your applications relying on Groq may need occasional updates to continue working.

Once a model is announced as deprecated, make sure to migrate usage to a recommended replacement before the shutdown date to avoid failing requests. All API deprecations along with recommended replacements are listed below.

## [Model Deprecation Lifecycle Guidelines](#model-deprecation-lifecycle-guidelines)

### [Production vs. Preview Models](#production-vs-preview-models)

We ship fast so you can build fast with access to the latest and greatest models, while also providing a distinction between preview models and production models. Generally, models we host start off in preview and either graduate to production based on demand or get replaced by a production model with similar or better capabilities.

#### [Production Models](#production-models)

* **Stability Expectations**: Production models are intended for use in your production environments and meet our high standards for speed, quality, and reliability.
* **Migration Support**: When a production model is deprecated, we will provide a clear migration path and recommended replacement model.

#### [Preview Models](#preview-models)

* **Evaluation Purpose**: Preview models are often early releases or early access models that are intended for evaluation purposes only and should not be used in production environments.
* **Limited Support**: Preview models may be discontinued at short notice with limited advance warning.
* **Experimental Usage**: Preview models often showcase new capabilities or architectures and may be refined based on user feedback.

### [Deprecation Process](#deprecation-process)

When a model is marked for deprecation, we follow this standardized process:

1. **Announcement Phase**:

  * Email notification to all affected users
  * Documentation update on our deprecation page with clear recommendation for replacement model(s)
2. **Transition Phase**:

  * Model remains fully functional during this period
  * Technical support continues for migration assistance
  * We recommend testing workloads with the replacement model during this time
3. **Automatic Upgrade Phase** (when applicable):

  * For some models, we may implement an automatic upgrade to the recommended replacement
  * This provides continuity while you complete your migration
4. **End-of-Life**:

  * After the deprecation date, the model will no longer be accessible
  * Requests to deprecated model IDs will return errors

### [Best Practices for Customers](#best-practices-for-customers)

* Regularly check our deprecation page for updates
* Test replacement models thoroughly before the deprecation date
* Plan migration efforts according to the announced timeline
* Consider designing your systems to be model-agnostic where possible

On December 6, 2024, in partnership with Meta, we released `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` and `llama-3.3-70b-specdec`, and notified users that we would deprecate their 3.1 counterparts in favor of hosting Llama 3.3 with significant quality improvements for a better experience.

To facilitate a smooth transition, we will maintain the current `llama-3.1-70b-versatile` and `llama-3.1-70b-specdec` model IDs until December 20, 2024\. At that time, requests to these model IDs will automatically upgrade to their respective 3.3 versions. Beginning January 24, 2025, requests to both 3.1 model IDs will return errors.

While these new models deliver improved quality, they may produce different responses than their predecessors. We recommend migrating to explicitly using `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` and `llama-3.3-70b-specdec` before December 20, 2024, for testing.
